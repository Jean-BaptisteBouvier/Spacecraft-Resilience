# Spacecraft-Resilience

This project gathers the MATLAB codes used in the paper "Resilient Trajectory Tracking to Partial Loss of Control Authority over Actuators with Actuation Delay" by Jean-Baptiste Bouvier, Himmat Panag, Robyn Woollands and Melkior Ornik.
This work is published in ____ and available .

The file 'spacecraft_resilience.m' verifies the resilience of the spacecraft dynamics and compute its reachable set.
It requires the MATLAB toolboxes mpt and CORA, respectively available [https://www.mpt3.org/](here) and [https://tumcps.github.io/CORA/](here).

The file 'main.m' computes the resilient trajectory tracking.
The minimal fuel reference trajectory requires the cvx toolbox on MATLAB available [http://cvxr.com/cvx/](here).
