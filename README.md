# Spacecraft-Resilience

This project gathers the MATLAB codes used in the paper "Resilient Trajectory Tracking to Partial Loss of Control Authority over Actuators with Actuation Delay" by Jean-Baptiste Bouvier, Himmat Panag, Robyn Woollands and Melkior Ornik.
This work is published in    and not available yet.

The file 'spacecraft_resilience.m' verifies the resilience of the spacecraft dynamics and compute its reachable set.
It requires the MATLAB toolboxes mpt and CORA, respectively available [here](https://www.mpt3.org/) and [here](https://tumcps.github.io/CORA/).

The file 'main.m' computes the resilient trajectory tracking.
The minimal fuel reference trajectory requires the cvx toolbox on MATLAB available [ere](http://cvxr.com/cvx/).
